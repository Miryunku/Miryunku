Hello, I am Miryunku.<br>
I can speak english and spanish with fluency.<br>
日本語が話せますけどペラペラではない、それでも、私に話したいと日本語しか理解できないなら、心配しないで！私に話して！日本文法が分かれる、唯一の問題は私の語彙力が低いだけですけど、そのために辞典が存在する！

I like programming in C, C++ and C# and I am interested in various things about programming, recently I started studying graphics programming.

About videogames, I am currently playing music games like LunaticRave2 but I enjoy various types of videogames, like Zelda, Metroid, and Resident Evil.

I used to draw but now I rarely do it.
